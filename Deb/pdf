Did he try pdftotext? On Debian it's in the poppler-utils package.
Some PDFs are impossible (they're just an image of text), others
are very difficult (anything with a 2-column layout probably
won't work, and even with some simple layouts you'll see spaces
missing or other problems) but some PDFs convert just fine.
And on the documents where pdftotext doesn't work, a PDF editor
probably wouldn't do much better.
