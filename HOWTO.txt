apt install rsync vim vim-doc vim-scripts git git-doc openssh-server \
    msmtp tree arp-scan tofrodos dnsutils tree build-essential \
    wget unicode mutt python3-pip pylint acpi cups lpr
# also consider adding sqlite3 & sqlite3-doc to the above
# don't need virtualenv - not sure but may => problems if included!
# cups-client comes in automatically with cups
# Can't get lpr command to work inspite of a reboot or the following:
# $ alex@t460:~$ sudo adduser alex lpadmin
# >> The user `alex' is already a member of `lpadmin'.
# ...but the 'lp' command works & does pretty much the same:
#     i.e. options such as -n <number> and -o orientation-requested=4

# Could it be that installing unicode takes care of the following????....
mkdir /usr/share/unicode
cd /usr/share/unicode
wget http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt
# Without doing the above commands, /usr/share/unicode directory is
# already there with _lots_ of content!!!

# Bring in dot files:
# see File: dotfiles2move 
# Done Fri 13 May 2022 01:39:43 PM PDT
# those with asterix (#*) should be backed up first?
# i.e. cp .bashrc .bashrc-original

.bashrc  #*
.gnupg   #*
.msmtprc  #*?  # not brought in by insalling msmtp??
.mutt     #*?  # not brought in by insalling mutt??
.muttalias   # listing of my contacts and their emails
.muttakg     #}   mutt configuration
.muttclubg   #}   for each of
.mutteasy    #}   several 
.muttsonic   #}   'mta's
.pw.akg      #}   passwords
.pw.clubg    #}   for each of
.pw.easy     #}   several
.pw.sonic    #}   'mta's
.ssh
.gitconfig
.vimrc
.vim  # see below:
# For .vim [1]  perhaps use the following:
# rsync -a --delete --exclude='.git' .vim ~/
# to get .vim/bundle # without the .git files
# (but still get .gitignore!)
### The above done as of Fri 13 May 2022 02:03:28 PM PDT

# To clone from github.com, be sure .ssh has been moved over,
# cd into ~/Git/Club (or where-ever) and issue the following:
git clone git@github.com:alexKleider/Club_Utilities.git ./Utils
# The "./Utils" at the end causes "Club_Utilities.git" to be cloned
# into a ./Utils directory rather than ./Club_Utilities.
# Note: the git url needed can be found by going to the github 
# repository and clicking on the green [code] box.

# no need for root privileges for the following:
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenvwrapper
# the above worked Fri 13 May 2022 02:26:21 PM PDT

# Remember that I have a number of files shared by various code bases
# and in each code base they are a hard link so all are the same.
# As of time of writing there are the following:
# 1. helpers.py  x3   # $CLUBU/helpers.py, $LIB/code/helpers.py, 3rd??
# 2. send.py  x2  # $CLUBU/PyMail/send.py  $LIB/code/send.py
# 3. <I think there is a third- haven't found it yet!>
# ... so after a re-install these links must be re-established


#Note: Debian11 ships with python 3.9.2; no python 2 is included!
$ mkvirtualenv -p python3 p9  # --python="/usr/bin/python3" p9
## More info in the 'Venv/virtualenvwrapper' file.
$ /home/alex/.virtualenvs/p9/bin/python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
$ /home/alex/.virtualenvs/p9/bin/python3 -m pip install docopt



NOTE:

[1] the long way to bring in what's needed in the ~/.vim directory:
mkdir ~/.vim
cd ~/.vim
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
cd bundle
git clone https://github.com/alvan/vim-closetag
cd
