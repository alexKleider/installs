diacritics or diacritical marks: special marks such as umlaut, accents aigus,
and grave. 

digraph: two letter combination such as "ph" in paragraph.

Vim uses the notion of "two-letter" combinations to describe its input
mechanism for characters with special characteristics such as diacritics.
[see: /usr/share/vim/vim72/doc/digraph.txt 
&/or :help digraph ]

^K x
use - to get 
c,    cedilla (ç)
e^    circumflex (ê)
e>    (ê)
e'    aigus (é)
a!    grave (à)
a:    (ä)
?I    inverted question mark (¿)
ss    German sharp S (ß)


Greek: p* for pi (π)
Russian: p= for "pe" (п)   # Sometimes need "%" instead of "=".

Also can use Vim's second method: set the digraph option:
:set digraph
..following which you can enter the two characters separated by
backspace instead of preceeded by ^K
