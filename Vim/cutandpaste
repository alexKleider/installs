from Alan:
If I use console vim I use the regular X cut n paste
using the middle mouse button. There are vim tools for
doing it, including accessing multiple clipboards etc,
but I never use those.

from Bob Stepp:

xsel is one of a few *nix programs for interacting with the X server clipboard
selections.  It has nothing to do with the Vim/Neovim editors other than they
can make use of them.  You can Google for xsel or use your man pages for more
info.  Neovim is just a fork of Vim that so far retains compatibility with
Vim, so for most purposes Vim and Neovim are interchangeable.

If this worked than you can forget about xsel.  Sounds like you did not have
to worry about the issues I originally had.

>How do you 'copy' a highlighted segment from vim into your system clipboard?

Just yank the selection into the "+" register just like you would yank text
into a lettered register.

Hope I'm clearer this time.  Must go to work!

BTW, you might want to Google or manpage xsel or whatever your system uses.  X
Server/X Windows has THREE selections it deals with: Primary, Secondary and
Clipboard.  It is useful to know the differences for both your mouse
functionality and using Vim and whatnot.
