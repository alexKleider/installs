Vundle  (Vim Bundle)
https://www.linuxfordevices.com/tutorials/linux/vundle
The following goes into .vimrc:
"""
set nocompatible              " be iMproved, required
filetype off                  " required

" set the runtime path to include Vundle and initialize Vundle
" The directory should be changed in case you download it somewhere else
set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
call vundle#begin()

" let Vundle manage Vundle, required
Plugin 'VundleVim/Vundle.vim'

" All the plugins to be installed are to be mentioned here
" inside the vundle#begin and vundle#end
" To Install Plugin from a repository:
" Plugin 'git://git.wincent.com/command-t.git'
" or if from Github can simplify to
" Plugin 'tpope/vim-fugitive'

" When editing is completed, use following commands:
" :source %
" :PluginInstall

call vundle#end()            " required
filetype plugin indent on    " required
"""

After plugins are added as described above (i.e. the closetag plug in
described bellow) one must either
1. open vim and issue command:
:PluginInstall
or 2. from command line:
vim +PluginInstall +qall

CloseTag
https://github.com/alvan/vim-closetag
Between :call vundle#begin() and :call vundle#end():
Plugin 'alvan/vim-closetag'
...and in .vimrc use "let g:" options to specify file types in which
tags are to be closed or not. For example:
let g:closetag_filenames = '*.html,*.xhtml,*.phtml'
