How to do it right:

Step 1:  Shop around in stores or online, and make a list of printers
you think are promising.

Step 2:  Look up each such model at the http://openprinting.org/
database.  Sadly, this is no longer Grant Taylor's project, but got
taken over by the Borg -- er, by Linux Foundation.  So, among other
Linux Foundation-related damage, that URL is now a redirect to
wherever
Linux Foundation stuffs it, this week.

If you fumble around, you can eventually get somewhere useful, such as
(after being redirected _back_):  http://www.openprinting.org/printers

Step 3:  While examining Openprinting entries, look for printers that
are said to work 'perfectly' on Linux as opposed to 'partially' or
'paperweight' (not at all).  Look for at least 1GB of built-in RAM.
Look for printers that do _not_ require you to download supplemental
software or 'drivers' from the hardware manufacturer's Web site, as
those will almost always be buggy, brittle proprietary crud (if it
were
otherwise, why wouldn't they have been merged into foomatic, etc.?).
Look for native support for PostScript and/or PCL6.  And, last, look
for the printer to include a network port, which is a marker for it
probably not being cheap junk.

Brother International doesn't have, by any means, a monopoly on
suitable
models -- but does make them.


How to do it wrong:

Step 1:  Buy the printer, and intend to figure out Linux support
later.
