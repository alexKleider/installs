Copy/Paste made to work using Vundle etc (see under Vim)

The following seems something I tried in the past- probably no longer
necessary:

add the following line to the ~/.Xresources file: 
XTerm*VT100.translations: #override <Btn1Up>: select-end(PRIMARY, CLIPBOARD, CUT_BUFFER0)
You can test it with an xterm: 
xterm -xrm 'XTerm*VT100.translations: #override <Btn1Up>: select-end(PRIMARY, CLIPBOARD, CUT_BUFFER0)'
