add the following line to the ~/.Xresources file: 

XTerm*VT100.translations: #override <Btn1Up>: select-end(PRIMARY, CLIPBOARD, CUT_BUFFER0)

You can test it with an xterm: 

xterm -xrm 'XTerm*VT100.translations: #override <Btn1Up>: select-end(PRIMARY, CLIPBOARD, CUT_BUFFER0)'


PS  Copy/Paste made to work using Vundle etc (see under Vim)
I don't know what this is for (as of Sat 28 Aug 2021 03:40:57 PM PDT)
