When running the following command:

$ pip3 install --user virtualenvwrapper

... got the following warning:

  The script pbr is installed in '/home/glu/.local/bin' which is not on PATH.
  Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress this warning, use --no-warn-script-location.
  The script virtualenv-clone is installed in '/home/glu/.local/bin' which is not on PATH.
  Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress this warning, use --no-warn-script-location.

True: ~/.local/bin/pbr does exist and is not in $PATH but all seems to
work inspite of this.

$ echo $PATH >> 
/home/alex/.virtualenvs/p10/bin:/home/alex/.pyenv/plugins/pyenv-virtualenvwrapper/shims:/home/alex/.pyenv/libexec:/home/alex/.pyenv/plugins/python-build/bin:/home/alex/.pyenv/plugins/pyenv-virtualenvwrapper/bin:/home/alex/.pyenv/plugins/pyenv-virtualenv/bin:/home/alex/.pyenv/plugins/pyenv-update/bin:/home/alex/.pyenv/plugins/pyenv-installer/bin:/home/alex/.pyenv/plugins/pyenv-doctor/bin:/home/alex/.pyenv/plugins/pyenv-virtualenv/shims:/home/alex/.pyenv/shims:/home/alex/.pyenv/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games

... which does NOT include ~/.local/bin but all seems to work ok
anyway so perhaps there's no need to heed this warning.
